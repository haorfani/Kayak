- Saving a log file with nodeJS

	1. First you need to download and install nodeJS to your computer https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	2. $ mkdir log
	3. $ cd log
	4. $ npm init
	5. $ npm install --save ttn
	6. $ npm install json2csv
	7. You copy index.js file from github to log

	You run it with $ node .
	and when then you will be able to see a file with SF and BW with a timestamp
	 
	Note: If you want to modify nodeJS there is an example here https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/nodejs/quick-start.html and the API is located here https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/nodejs/api.html
